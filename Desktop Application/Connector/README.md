# Node.js Part

This is the main connector used by the Desktop Application to communicate with the Inworld servers. You need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

**Requirements:**

- Node.js v18.12 or later

**Installation:**

1. `npm install` to install all required packages.
2. Create a folder named "node" within this directory.
3. Locate your Node.js installation and copy the following files:
    - install_tools.bat
    - node.exe
    - nodevars.bat
    
By copying these files, you create a standalone Node.js environment that doesn't require players to download Node.js themselves.
